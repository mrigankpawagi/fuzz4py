Fuzzing Focus for Python 3.13:

**Interpreter:**

* **Free-threading (PEP 703):**  This is a major change to CPython's core concurrency model. Focus on multi-threaded applications, especially those using C extensions, to identify race conditions and memory corruption issues.  Test with and without the GIL.
* **JIT Compiler (PEP 744):** While experimental and off by default, the JIT compiler presents a new attack surface.  Target code paths that are likely to be JIT-compiled (hot loops, tight functions) with varying inputs to uncover edge cases.
* **`locals()` semantics (PEP 667):** The changed behavior of `locals()` can impact debuggers and introspection tools.  Fuzz these tools specifically, focusing on optimized scopes.

**Language:**

* **Docstring whitespace stripping:** This seemingly minor change can affect tools that parse docstrings (e.g., doctests). Fuzz doctests with varying indentation.
* **Annotation scopes:**  The allowance of lambdas and comprehensions within annotation scopes expands the possible syntax.  Fuzz complex type annotations.
* **`__static_attributes__` and `__firstlineno__`:** These new class attributes could interact unexpectedly with metaprogramming. Fuzz metaclasses and class decorators.

**Standard Library:**

* **`copy.replace()` and replace protocol:**  This new feature introduces a new way to manipulate objects. Fuzz custom classes implementing `__replace__()` and built-in types that support it.
* **`dbm.sqlite3`:**  As the new default `dbm` backend, this module requires thorough testing. Fuzz database operations with various inputs, including malformed data.
* **`os` module timer functions:** The new timer functions on Linux provide a new area to explore for potential issues. Fuzz these functions with different time values and flags.
* **`ssl.create_default_context()` changes:** The stricter default flags in `ssl` can lead to connection failures with certain certificates. Fuzz SSL connections with a wide range of certificates.
* **`typing` module additions (PEPs 696, 702, 705, 742):**  The new typing features introduce new syntax and semantics for type checkers. Fuzz complex type annotations and type checker interactions.
* **Removed modules
